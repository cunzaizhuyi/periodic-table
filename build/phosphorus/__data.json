As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. Instead phosphorus-containing minerals are almost always present in their maximally oxidised state, as inorganic phosphate rocks.","symbol":"P","shells":[2,8,5],"electron_configuration":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3","electron_configuration_semantic":"[Ne] 3s2 3p3","electron_affinity":72.037,"electronegativity_pauling":2.19,"ionization_energies":[1011.8,1907,2914.1,4963.6,6273.9,21267,25431,29872,35905,40950,46261,54110,59024,271791,296195],"cpk-hex":"ff8000","row":3,"column":15,"n_neutrons":16,"n_protons":15,"n_electrons":15,"radioactive":null,"natural":true,"metal":null,"nonmetal":true,"metalloid":null,"atomic_radius":1.2,"electronegativity":2.19,"first_ionization":10.4867,"melting_point":317.25,"boiling_point":553,"number_of_isotopes":7,"year":1669,"specific_heat":0.769,"n_shells":3,"n_valence":5,"jmol_color":"(1.0, 0.502, 0.0)","covalent_radius":1.07}}}]}
