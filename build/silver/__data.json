A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it possesses the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and reflectivity of any metal. The metal occurs naturally in its pure, free form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite.","symbol":"Ag","shells":[2,8,18,18,1],"electron_configuration":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s1 4d10","electron_configuration_semantic":"[Kr] 4d10 5s1","electron_affinity":125.862,"electronegativity_pauling":1.93,"ionization_energies":[731,2070,3361],"cpk-hex":"c0c0c0","row":5,"column":11,"n_neutrons":61,"n_protons":47,"n_electrons":47,"radioactive":null,"natural":true,"metal":true,"nonmetal":null,"metalloid":null,"atomic_radius":1.8,"electronegativity":1.93,"first_ionization":7.5762,"melting_point":1234.15,"boiling_point":2435,"number_of_isotopes":27,"year":"~3000 BC","specific_heat":0.235,"n_shells":5,"n_valence":null,"jmol_color":"(0.753, 0.753, 0.753)","covalent_radius":1.45}}}]}
