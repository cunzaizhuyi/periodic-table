A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements on Earth. As such, it is a rare earth element which is associated with several other rare elements in the mineral gadolinite from Ytterby in Sweden, where yttrium, ytterbium, and terbium were discovered.","symbol":"Er","shells":[2,8,18,30,8,2],"electron_configuration":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f12","electron_configuration_semantic":"[Xe] 4f12 6s2","electron_affinity":30.1,"electronegativity_pauling":1.24,"ionization_energies":[589.3,1150,2194,4120],"cpk-hex":"00e675","row":9,"column":14,"n_neutrons":99,"n_protons":68,"n_electrons":68,"radioactive":null,"natural":true,"metal":true,"nonmetal":null,"metalloid":null,"atomic_radius":2.5,"electronegativity":1.24,"first_ionization":6.1077,"melting_point":1795.15,"boiling_point":3503,"number_of_isotopes":16,"year":1843,"specific_heat":0.168,"n_shells":6,"n_valence":null,"jmol_color":"(0.0, 0.902, 0.459)","covalent_radius":1.89}}}]}
