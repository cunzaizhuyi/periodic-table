It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye (after einsteinium).","symbol":"Cf","shells":[2,8,18,32,28,8,2],"electron_configuration":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6 7s2 5f10","electron_configuration_semantic":"[Rn] 5f10 7s2","electron_affinity":-97.31,"electronegativity_pauling":1.3,"ionization_energies":[608],"cpk-hex":"a136d4","row":10,"column":12,"n_neutrons":153,"n_protons":98,"n_electrons":98,"radioactive":true,"natural":null,"metal":true,"nonmetal":null,"metalloid":null,"atomic_radius":null,"electronegativity":1.3,"first_ionization":6.2817,"melting_point":1925.15,"boiling_point":1173,"number_of_isotopes":123,"year":1950,"specific_heat":null,"n_shells":7,"n_valence":null,"jmol_color":"(0.631, 0.212, 0.831)","covalent_radius":null}}}]}
