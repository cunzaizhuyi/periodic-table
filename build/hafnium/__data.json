A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1923, making it the penultimate stable element to be discovered (rhenium was identified two years later).","symbol":"Hf","shells":[2,8,18,32,10,2],"electron_configuration":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d2","electron_configuration_semantic":"[Xe] 4f14 5d2 6s2","electron_affinity":17.18,"electronegativity_pauling":1.3,"ionization_energies":[658.5,1440,2250,3216],"cpk-hex":"4dc2ff","row":6,"column":4,"n_neutrons":106,"n_protons":72,"n_electrons":72,"radioactive":null,"natural":true,"metal":true,"nonmetal":null,"metalloid":null,"atomic_radius":2.2,"electronegativity":1.3,"first_ionization":6.8251,"melting_point":2500.15,"boiling_point":4876,"number_of_isotopes":17,"year":1923,"specific_heat":0.144,"n_shells":6,"n_valence":null,"jmol_color":"(0.302, 0.761, 1.0)","covalent_radius":1.75}}}]}
